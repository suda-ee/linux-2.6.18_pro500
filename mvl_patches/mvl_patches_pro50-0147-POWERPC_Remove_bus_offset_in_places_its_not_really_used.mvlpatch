# [POWERPC] Remove bus_offset in places its not really used
# 
# The user of the fsl_pcie code doesn't set bus_offset and 82xx doesn't
# require it either.  Remove the places in the code that reference it so
# we can remove it all together.

[POWERPC] Remove bus_offset in places its not really used

The user of the fsl_pcie code doesn't set bus_offset and 82xx doesn't
require it either.  Remove the places in the code that reference it so
we can remove it all together.
