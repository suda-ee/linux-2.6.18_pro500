#     net: fix missing pneigh entries in the neighbor seq_file code
#     
#     When pneigh entries exist, but the user's read buffer isn't sufficient to
#     hold them all, one of the pneigh entries will be missing from the results.
#     
#     In neigh_get_idx_any, the number of elements which neigh_get_idx
#     encountered is not correctly subtracted from the position number before
#     the call to pneigh_get_idx.  neigh_get_idx reduces the position by 1 for
#     each call to neigh_get_next, but it does not reduce it by one for the
#     first element (neigh_get_first). The patch alters the neigh_get_idx and
#     pneigh_get_idx functions to subtract one from pos, for the first element,
#     when pos is non-zero.
