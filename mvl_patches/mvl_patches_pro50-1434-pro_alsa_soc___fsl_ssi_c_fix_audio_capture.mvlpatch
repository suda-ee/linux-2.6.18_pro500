Description:
PRO: ALSA: soc - fsl_ssi.c fix audio capture

Since we're using SSI in synchronous mode, the STCCR register controls
both the receive and transmit sections. So, when we're trying to record
anything, stccr register does not get initialized, thus the output file
filled with the white noise.

Fix this by initializing the STCCR for both playback and capture. If
TX/RX widths don't match, return that we're busy at the moment.
