Description:
[PRO NET] phylib, broadcom: add support for BCM5481 PHY

This patch adds support for BCM5481 PHY. Unfortunately it's hard to
get specifications for this PHY, so its special register 0x18 isn't
annotated properly (but we know it's used to set up the delays).

I've kept the magic numbers, so we'll not forget to fix it at the
first opportunity, and will name that register and its bits correctly.
