# 
# Further to the previous patch fixing the calculation of page number,
# both branches are using the same result. Clean up the function
# accordingly, calculating it (and also masking with pagemask) only in one
# place.

Subject: [PATCH] [MTD] [NAND] Tidy up handling of page number in nand_block_bad()

Further to the previous patch fixing the calculation of page number,
both branches are using the same result. Clean up the function
accordingly, calculating it (and also masking with pagemask) only in one
place.
