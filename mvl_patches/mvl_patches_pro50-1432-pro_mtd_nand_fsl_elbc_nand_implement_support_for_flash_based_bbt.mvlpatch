# for bad blocks on every boot.
# 
# Because ELBC controller may provide HW-generated ECCs we should adjust
# bbt pattern and bbt version positions in the OOB free area.

This patch implements support for flash-based BBT for chips working
through ELBC NAND controller, so that NAND core will not have to re-scan
for bad blocks on every boot.

Because ELBC controller may provide HW-generated ECCs we should adjust
bbt pattern and bbt version positions in the OOB free area.
