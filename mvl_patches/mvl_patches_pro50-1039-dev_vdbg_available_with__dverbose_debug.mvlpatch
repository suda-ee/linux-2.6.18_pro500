#     dev_vdbg(), available with -DVERBOSE_DEBUG
#     
#     This defines a dev_vdbg() call, which is enabled with -DVERBOSE_DEBUG.
#     When enabled, dev_vdbg() acts just like dev_dbg().  When disabled, it is a
#     NOP ...  just like dev_dbg() without -DDEBUG.  The specific code was moved
#     out of a USB patch, but lots of drivers have similar support.
#     
#     That is, code can now be written to use an additional level of debug
#     output, selected at compile time.  Many driver authors have found this
#     idiom to be very useful.  A typical usage model is for "normal" debug
#     messages to focus on fault paths and not be very "chatty", so that those
#     messages can be left on during normal operation without much of a
#     performance or syslog load.  On the other hand "verbose" messages would be
#     noisy enough that they wouldn't normally be enabled; they might even affect
#     timings enough to change system or driver behavior.
