------------------------------------------------------
Subject: hrtimer: prevent overrun DoS in hrtimer_forward()
From: Thomas Gleixner <tglx@linutronix.de>

hrtimer_forward() does not check for the possible overflow of
timer->expires.  This can happen on 64 bit machines with large interval
values and results currently in an endless loop in the softirq because the
expiry value becomes negative and therefor the timer is expired all the
time.

Check for this condition and set the expiry value to the max.  expiry time
in the future.  The fix should be applied to stable kernel series as well.
