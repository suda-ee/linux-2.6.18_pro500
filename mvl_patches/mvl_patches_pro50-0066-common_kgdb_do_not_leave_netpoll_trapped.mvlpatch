# Patch: -common_kgdb_do_not_leave_netpoll_trapped
# Date: Thu Jul  5 15:37:33 2007
# Source: MontaVista Software, Inc.
# MR: 23956
# Type: Defect Fix
# Disposition: accepted by KGDB project
# Signed-off-by: Sergei Shtylyov <sshtylyov@ru.mvista.com>
# Description:
# 
# There are a couple of inconsistencies with calling KGDB driver's pre_exception()
# and post_exception() methods:
# 
# - the pre_exception() method may be called several times in a row because of
#   'acquirelock' label preceding its call -- the code can go back to this label
#   in SMP kernel and therefore netpoll's 'trapping' variable can be incremented
#   more than once but will only be decremented once upon exit;
# 
# - if KGDB hits a disabled breakpoint (can only happen on x86), the code will
#   jump to 'kgdb_restore' label bypassing a call to the post_exception() method.
# 
# Fix this by moving pre_exception() method call below kgdb_skipexception() check.
# Align the label and comment style, while at it...

Fix this by moving pre_exception() method call below kgdb_skipexception() check.
