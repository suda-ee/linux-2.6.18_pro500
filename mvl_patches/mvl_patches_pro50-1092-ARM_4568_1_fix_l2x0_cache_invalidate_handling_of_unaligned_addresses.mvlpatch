#     [ARM] 4568/1: fix l2x0 cache invalidate handling of unaligned addresses
#     
#     The l2x0_inv_range() function doesn't handle unaligned addresses
#     correctly. It's necessary to clean the cache lines that are at the
#     start and end of the invalidate range, if the addresses are not aligned,
#     to prevent corruption of other data sharing the same cache line.
