# MR: 25976
# Type: Enhancement

# Description:
# 
# Publish the devices listed in dts under SOC as of_device just like what
# mpc85xx_mds platforms do. The 85xx cds and ads platforms currently do not
# export the devices in dts as of_device.

# Signed-off-by: Dave Jiang <djiang@mvista.com>
# 
# NOTE: This patch was pulled from F5. It was added there to publish the
# EDAC devices in the DTS. We need it here to establish the framework for
# the new flash bindings.
