[PATCH] PIIX: remove check for broken MW DMA mode 0

There's no need to check in piix_config_drive_for_dma() for broken MW DMA
mode 0 as this mode is not supported by the driver (it sets
hwif->mwdma_mask to 0x6), and hence can't be selected by ide_dma_speed().

(Alan sayeth "Probably right but if not you've got a subtle corruptor.  Should
at least stick a BUG_ON mode 0 setting right close when the mode is set.")
