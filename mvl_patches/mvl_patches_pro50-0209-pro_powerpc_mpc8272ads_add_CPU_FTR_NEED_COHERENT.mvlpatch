# Patch: -pro_powerpc_mpc8272ads_add_CPU_FTR_NEED_COHERENT
# Date: Wed Sep 26 11:12:02 2007
# Source: MontaVista Software, Inc.
# MR: 24308
# Type: Defect Fix
# Disposition: needs submitting to linuxppc-dev
# Signed-off-by: Wade Farnsworth <wfarnsworth@mvista.com>
# Description:
#     Add CPU_FTR_NEED_COHERENT for MPC8260 processor family.  This prevents
#     some PCI errors from occurring on the MPC8272ADS.
# 
#     This will be submitted upstream in a future version of Scott Wood's
#     8xx/82xx patchset.
