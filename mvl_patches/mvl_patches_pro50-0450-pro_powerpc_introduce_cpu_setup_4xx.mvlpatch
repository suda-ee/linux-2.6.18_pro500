# MR: 25002
# Type: Enhancement

# Description:
#     Introduce cpu_setup functionality for ppc44x platform.
#     Low level cpu-spefic initialization routines should be 
#     placed in cpu_setup_44x.S and a callback should be
#     added to cputable. The cpu setup is invoked 
#     by identify_cpu() function at early init.
