# Date: Mon Jul 28 11:49:42 2008
# Source: MontaVista Software, Inc. | URL | Some Guy <email@addr>
# MR: 24889 
# Type: Defect Fix
# Disposition: merged from 2.6.24-rc8-rt1

# Description:
# 
# 	The posix-cpu-timer thread is currently woken on each timer
# interrupt. It then checks if there are timers to expire and exits. Since
# we wake a thread each and every timer interrupt that skew the load. This
# problem has manifested it self with a few other threads that woke up each
# timer interrupt. Solution is to check for expired posix cpu-timers and only
# wake the thread if there is woke to do.
