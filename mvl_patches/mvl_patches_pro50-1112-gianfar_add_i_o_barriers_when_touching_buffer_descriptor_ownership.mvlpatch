#     gianfar: Add I/O barriers when touching buffer descriptor ownership.
#     
#     The hardware must not see that is given ownership of a buffer until it is
#     completely written, and when the driver receives ownership of a buffer,
#     it must ensure that any other reads to the buffer reflect its final
#     state.  Thus, I/O barriers are added where required.
#     
#     Without this patch, I have observed GCC reordering the setting of
#     bdp->length and bdp->status in gfar_new_skb.  Hardware reordering
#     was also theoretically possible.
