# 
# EHCI hooks for high speed electrical tests of the root hub ports.
# 
# The expectation is that a usermode program actually triggers the test,
# making the same control request it would make for an external hub.
# Tests for peripheral upstream ports would issue a different request.
# In all cases, the hardware needs re-initialization before it could
# be used "normally" again (e.g. unplug/replug, rmmod/modprobe).

Subject: [PATCH] USB: EHCI hooks for high speed electrical tests

EHCI hooks for high speed electrical tests of the root hub ports.

The expectation is that a usermode program actually triggers the test,
making the same control request it would make for an external hub.
Tests for peripheral upstream ports would issue a different request.
In all cases, the hardware needs re-initialization before it could
be used "normally" again (e.g. unplug/replug, rmmod/modprobe).
