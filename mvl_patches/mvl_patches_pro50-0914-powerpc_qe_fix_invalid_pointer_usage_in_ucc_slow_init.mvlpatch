#     [POWERPC] QE: fix invalid pointer usage in ucc_slow_init()
#     
#     In two places, ucc_slow_init() passes a physical address instead of the
#     virtual address to functions that were expecting the latter, causing a kernel
#     panic.  us_info->regs contains the physical address of the UCC register set.
#     The registers are ioremap'd to kernel space, and the virtual pointers are
#     stored in us_regs.  The code was using us_info->regs when it should have been
#     using us_regs.
