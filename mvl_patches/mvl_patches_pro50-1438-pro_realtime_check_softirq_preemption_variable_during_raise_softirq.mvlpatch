# Description:
# 
# 	One case during raise_softirq() which is wrong in !PREEMPT_RT. Usually
# if you inside and interrupt the softirq will be handled when the interrupt is
# finished, so you don't wake the softirq thread in that case. However, PREEMPT_RT
# wants the wakeup in both cases.
# 
# So I added a new check against softirq_preemption with should prevent this in
# !PREEMPT_RT.

Description:

	One case during raise_softirq() which is wrong in !PREEMPT_RT. Usually
if you inside and interrupt the softirq will be handled when the interrupt is
finished, so you don't wake the softirq thread in that case. However, PREEMPT_RT
wants the wakeup in both cases.

So I added a new check against softirq_preemption with should prevent this in
!PREEMPT_RT.
